# Concept

    . The sender accesses a web interface (using MetaMask) and sends AVO to a smart contract along with a hash of the r  recipient's email address. A small amount of ETH should also be required for the transaction fee to the recipient.

    . An email is sent to the recipient with a link

    . The recipient clicks the link to access a web interface (using Metamask). If the recipient does not have a MetaMask wallet they should be guided to create one.

    .The recipient clicks "accept" and a transfer of the AVO is initiated by the backend server to the recipient's wallet address.
